	<h1>Notable coursework</h1>
	<p>
		Here are some of the most notable projects I've worked on during
		my courses at San Diego State. They're not organized in any
		particular order, but serve as a peek into what I've learned to
		create, at least while assigned to do something.

	<h2 id="cs450">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
	<small>Taken Fall &rsquo;25, course code CS 450</small>
	<p>
		The course covered a range of topics in artificial intelligence
		from agentic AI to large language models. The course final
		project was to apply Artificial Intelligence to solve a
		problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our group's final project was an AI study tool built with
		Next.JS and the Vercel AI SDK. Using a pipeline to process
		uploaded student files via a visual-language model, and
		using structured output language models, class notes were
		used to generate interactive quizzes.

	<h2 id="intro-soft-sys">Introduction to Software Systems</h2>
	<small>Taken Fall &rsquo;23, course code CS 250</small>
	<p>
		This course was structured as a mock workplace, aiming to teach
		important aspects of the software development lifecycle and how
		to work in teams to produce a concrete plan for a client. My
		group created a software specification for a PoS (Point of Sale)
		system, aimed for use at a clothing store.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goals of the project were to learn how to write
		professionally with a business audience in mind. The two main
		audiences were technical and non-technical. To that end, I
		enumerated the client's goals and a technical plan to
		achieve those goals. I also learned how to use LaTeX to produce
		professional documents, complete with vector diagrams.
	</p>
	<p>
		The final project consists of the manual, software
		requirements, software design specification, data management
		strategy, security analysis, software testing plan, and the life
		cycle. It represents the culmination of a semester's work.

	<h2 id="advanced-programming">Advanced Programming Languages</h2>
	<small>Taken Spring &rsquo;24, course code CS 420</small>
	<p>
		This course covered programming languages that could be
		considered &ldquo;advanced.&rdquo; As a class, we covered the
		languages of C, Haskell, MATLAB, and Prolog. These languages
		have unique features that make them suitable for certain classes
		of problems. Of special interest to me were Haskell and Prolog,
		which work quite differently from any other language I had
		used before.
	</p>
	<p>
		I completed four assignments, each with four reports. The
		reports and their source code, along with in-class works, are
		published on a <a class="texdownload" href="https://git.unix.dog/nullobsi/cs420">Git
			repository.</a>

	<small>Taken Summer &rsquo;24, course code LGBT 322</small>
	<p>
		In this course, I produced three &ldquo;Deep Dives&rdquo;
		examining literature and film from US queer history. As a queer
		person myself, I had a great experience learning about my
		community and the fights that took place just to gain a few
		rights.

	<small>Taken Fall &rsquo;22, course code RWS 200</small>
	<p>
		In this course, I produced 4 essays analyzing different aspects
		of written (and visual!) rhetoric, or producing an argument of
		my own. Over the semester we analyzed different pieces of
		writing and synthesized different sources into an argument.
