<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>
	I am a twenty-one-year-old computer science and mathematics student
	pursuing my bachelor&rsquo;s at San Diego State University. As a
	fourth-year student with another year in front of me, I seek to
	advance my professional development through concrete projects and
	research. I am gender-fluid and go by any pronouns.
</p>

<h1>Academic</h1>
<p>
	I have a strong interest in the crossroads with mathematics and
	computer science. Theoretical computer science sprung from the
	studies of math, and today I feel it is important to ground problems
	of computation in these mathematical underpinnings. My favorite
	courses (more can be seen in <a href="/coursework">Coursework</a>)
	have been those that apply rigorous mathematical proof to problems
	of technology. I excelled in Coding Theory, Algorithms, Computer
	Architecture, and Abstract Algebra, and I seek to further my
	knowledge in algebraic fields.
</p>

<h1>Work</h1>
<p>
	I currently work under <a href="https://taoxie.sdsu.edu/">Dr.
	Tao Xie</a> as an Instructional Student
	Assistant for the Computer Science Department at my university.
	I help students with course material during my office hours and
	grade student work, providing valuable feedback for the learning
	process.
</p>
<p>
	Earlier, I worked under <a href="https://vadim.sdsu.edu/">Dr. Vadim
	Ponomarenko</a> for his discrete mathematics course. My role
	was to guide students through the course, hosting weekly office
	hours. I reviewed student progress and extended education beyond the
	lectures.
</p>
<p>
	In high school, I worked as an after-school K12 instructor in JavaScript
	programming. While I worked with children to inspire knowledge in
	CS, I also managed the premises&rsquo; computer network and navigated
	an educator relationship with students&rsquo; parents.
